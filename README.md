# Ett internationellt programmeringsspr√•k

Computer programming has gone from being a relatively unusual skill to
something more and more people are learning, for jobs and as a hobby. The
global demand for programmers is increasing in line with the internet and
global digitalization. Most programming languages are however written in
and use English while the majority of the world does not use English as
its primary language. This report examines the possibility of creating a
specification and prototype implementation of a programming language which
is translateable between multiple different written languages as a way of
making programming more accessible to a global audience.
